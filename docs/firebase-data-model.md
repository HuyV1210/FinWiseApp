### 4.4 Sample Code Snippets

Below are representative code samples for core features. For more, see Appendix C.

```typescript
// Chatbot query handler (simplified)
function handleChatQuery(query: string): string {
  if (query.includes("balance")) {
    return "Your current balance is $1,200.";
  }
  if (query.includes("save")) {
    return "Consider setting aside 10% of your income each month.";
  }
  return "I'm here to help with your finances!";
}
```

```typescript
// Example: Adding a transaction to Firestore
import { firestore } from '../services/firebase';
import { addDoc, collection } from 'firebase/firestore';

async function addTransaction(transaction) {
  await addDoc(collection(firestore, 'transactions'), transaction);
}
```
