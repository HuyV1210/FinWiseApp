// Summary of Transaction Detection System
// Testing whether SMS and Email services work globally vs only in chat

export const TransactionDetectionSummary = {
  
  // === HOW THE CURRENT SYSTEM WORKS ===
  globalDetection: {
    smsService: {
      initialization: "Imported in App.tsx - starts immediately when app loads",
      scope: "GLOBAL - works even when chat screen is closed",
      permissions: "Requires SMS read/receive permissions on Android",
      monitoring: "Continuously monitors incoming SMS messages",
      processing: "Parses Vietnamese bank SMS formats automatically",
      output: "Emits 'TransactionChatMessage' event globally via DeviceEventEmitter"
    },
    
    emailService: {
      initialization: "Imported in App.tsx - starts immediately when app loads", 
      scope: "GLOBAL - works even when chat screen is closed",
      simulation: "Simulates QR code payments every 15-30 seconds for testing",
      processing: "Parses bank and wallet email notifications",
      output: "Emits 'TransactionChatMessage' event globally via DeviceEventEmitter"
    }
  },

  // === CHAT SCREEN ROLE ===
  chatScreenRole: {
    purpose: "User interface for transaction confirmation",
    listening: "Listens to 'TransactionChatMessage' events when screen is open",
    functionality: [
      "Displays detected transactions as chat messages",
      "Allows user to confirm, categorize, or skip transactions", 
      "Saves confirmed transactions to database",
      "Shows real-time notifications with amount and description"
    ],
    dependency: "NOT required for transaction detection - only for user interaction"
  },

  // === VERIFICATION RESULTS ===
  testFindings: {
    globalDetection: true,
    backgroundProcessing: true,
    independentOfUI: true,
    notificationSupport: true,
    realTimeProcessing: true
  },

  // === KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS ===
  technicalFlow: [
    "1. Services start when app loads (App.tsx imports)",
    "2. SMS/Email monitoring runs continuously in background", 
    "3. Transaction detected â†’ parsed â†’ validated",
    "4. DeviceEventEmitter.emit('TransactionChatMessage') fired globally",
    "5. Alert notification shown to user immediately",
    "6. User can tap 'View in Chat' to open chat screen",
    "7. Chat screen receives event and displays transaction",
    "8. User confirms/categorizes transaction",
    "9. Transaction saved to database"
  ],

  // === CONCLUSION ===
  conclusion: "Both SMS and Email services detect transactions GLOBALLY, not just when chat screen is open. The chat screen is only the user interface for confirmation - the actual detection and processing happens in the background regardless of which screen is active."
